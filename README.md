## ✨ About this web app 
This was a simple yet memorable web app designed to help groups of friends celebrate their year together. It offered a "private" space to collect and share photos and videos of cherished moments.  

### Features:  
- 📂 **Shared Memories**: Users could upload and share photos and videos within their friend groups.  
- ⏳ **Yearly Retrospective**: A collaborative gallery to reflect on the highlights of the year gone by.  
- 🌐 **Unified Accounts**: Shared the same backend authentication system as [From Me To You](https://github.com/setsudan/fmty), making it easy to transition between apps.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: Built using **Next.js**.  
- **Backend**: Powered by **PocketBase** for user authentication and data storage (now offline).
